# Snake Client Project

Snake game is a very popular retro video game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot(Snake) and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre. This game only be run locally.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from [here](https://github.com/taniarascia/snek).
